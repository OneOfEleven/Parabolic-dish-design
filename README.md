Suprising easy ways to create a perfect parabola such as bending a constant dia steel whip (2.5mm dia in this case).
You could use this to draw out a dish curve without having to create a template using a number of spot measurements.

Another way is to slowly and smoothly rotate a bowl (any shape) of liquid (water say), the surface, once settled, will form a perfect paraboloid.
<br />
This technique has been used as a visible light telescope mirror using say mercury as the liquid ..

An offset fed dish is nothing more than a cutout section (away from the center) of a larger straight fed circular prime focus dish. An offset fed dish is more efficient due to the feed antenna no longer being in the path of radiation.
